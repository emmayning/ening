👩🏻‍💻 I am a third year PhD student at the University of Illinois Chicago.

🤸🏻‍♀️ My work centers on understanding mood and cognition through passive sensing. 
Currently, I am working on two projects.
One project uses smartphone keyboard dynamics to study shifts in cognition and mood.
The other uses skin conductance to understand emotional fluctuations during music listening. 
I am also working on developing a method to efficiently compare time-series fluctuations across multiple 
individuals.
